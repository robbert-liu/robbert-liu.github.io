I will be beginning my PhD in mathematics at the University of Toronto in fall of 2025. I am mostly interested in questions concerning algebra, topology, and combinatorics. 

## Notes

* [Topological Bounds on Algebraic Computation Tree Complexity](./assets/files/mat495_essay.pdf) (2022)  
This essay was written for a reading course on computational complexity theory and are based on the content of the chapter of the same topic in *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* by Arora & Barak. The material is supplemented with an example and a topological proof omitted from the textbook.

## About Me

I read plenty of fiction and non-mathematical non-fiction. I also play several instruments and make music with my friends and some bands!
