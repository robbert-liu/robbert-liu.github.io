I will be beginning my PhD in mathematics at the University of Toronto in fall of 2025. I am mostly interested in questions concerning algebra, topology, and combinatorics. Outside of my academic studies, I read plenty of fiction and non-mathematical non-fiction, and I make music with my friends in some bands!

## Notes and Presentations

* [Topological Bounds on Algebraic Computation Tree Complexity](./assets/files/mat495_essay.pdf) (2022)
{::comment}
This essay was written for a reading course on computational complexity theory and are based on the content of the chapter of the same topic in *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* by Arora & Barak. The material is supplemented with an example and a topological proof omitted from the textbook.
