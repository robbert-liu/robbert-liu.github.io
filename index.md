## Notes

[Topological Bounds on Algebraic Computation Tree Complexity](./assets/notes/mat495_essay.pdf) (2022)â€”These notes were prepared for a reading course on computational complexity theory and are based on the content of the chapter of the same topic in *Computational Complexity: A Modern
Approach* by Arora & Barak. The material is supplemented with an additional example and an elementary topological proof omitted from the textbook.
