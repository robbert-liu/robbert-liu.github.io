I will be beginning my PhD in mathematics at the University of Toronto in fall of 2025. I am mostly interested in questions concerning algebra, topology, and combinatorics. 

## Notes

[Topological Bounds on Algebraic Computation Tree Complexity](./assets/notes/mat495_essay.pdf) (2022)\
This essay was written for a reading course on computational complexity theory and are based on the content of the chapter of the same topic in *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* by Arora & Barak. The material is supplemented with an example and a topological proof omitted from the textbook.\\

[Presentation Notes for Metric Structures](./assets/notes/mat494_rough.pdf) (2023)\
These are unedited organizational notes which were prepared for a presentation I gave in a reading course on model theory. The presentation introduces the theory of metric structures, an extension of classical model theory which considers structures equipped with a complete, bounded metric, which I learned from [these notes](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~begnac/articles/mtfms.pdf) by Yaacov, Berenstein, Henson, & Usvyatsov. The theory is a curiosity to me: one can find straightforward generalizations in the metric setting of all of the essential theorems of FOL, such as Compactness and LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem, which translate back to their classical formulations when specialized to the "discrete" fragment of classical structures.\\
